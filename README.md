# GraphQL HTML Scalar Type

A GraphQL **scalar** type that will sanitize an HTML string using [sanitize-html](http://npm.im/sanitize-html).

</div>

## Why Use This?

You may not actually need the `GraphQLHTML` scalar! Ideally, you'll have already taken steps to prevent malicious HTML from making it to a database. If you can trust that any HTML content your GraphQL server is sending to the client is safe, you can simply use the `String` scalar.

However, here are some examples of when you'll want to use a custom `HTML` scalar over `String`:

- You're consuming user supplied HTML content from a 3rd-party and you can't trust it's safe.
- User supplied content has been previously sanitized and considered "safe", but you need to remove certain HTML elements.
- You need to modify any HTML content in any way supported by [sanitize-html](http://npm.im/sanitize-html) across several resolvers.

## Install

## Getting Started

Let's assume we already have a simple [Apollo GraphQL server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/) set up, with a root `comments` query that responds with an array of user supplied comments.

```javascript
import { ApolloServer, gql } from 'apollo-server';

const typeDefs = gql`
  type Query {
    comments: [Comment]
  }

  type Comment {
    id: ID!
    body: String
  }
`;

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    comments: async (parent, args, context, info) => {
      return Promise.resolve([
        { id: 1, body: `Hello, <script>console.log('ðŸ‘»')</script> world!` },
      ]);
    },
  },
};

const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
});
```

The `Comment` type includes a `body` field containing the user supplied HTML content. If we haven't taken other steps to prevent malicious HTML from being saved to our database, we can sanitize the response with the `HTML` scalar.

Let's add `graphql-scalar-html` to our code, changing `body` from a `String` to the new `HTML` scalar type, and adding the custom `HTML` scalar to our schema:

```diff
  import { ApolloServer, gql } from 'apollo-server';
+ import GraphQLHTML from 'graphql-scalar-html';
+ // const GraphQLHTML = require('graphql-scalar-html');

  const typeDefs = gql`
    type Query {
      comments: [Comment]
    }

    type Comment {
      id: ID!
-     body: String
+     body: HTML
    }

+   scalar HTML
  `;
```

We also need to define the `HTML` scalar as a new `GraphQLHTML` instance in our resolvers (see Apollo's ["Custom Scalars"](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/features/scalars-enums.html#custom-scalars) documentation for more information).

```diff
  const resolvers = {
    Query: {
      comments: async (parent, args, context, info) => {
        return Promise.resolve([
          { id: 1, body: `<p>Hello, world<script>console.log('ðŸ‘»')</script>!</p>` },
        ]);
      },
    },
+   HTML: new GraphQLHTML({
+     allowedTags: [...GraphQLHTML.defaults.allowedTags, 'img'],
+   }),
  };

  const server = new ApolloServer({
    typeDefs,
    resolvers,
  });
```

If you've used [sanitize-html](http://npm.im/sanitize-html) before, the options argument of `GraphQLHTML` should look familiar - in fact, the `options` you'll set here are passed directly to [sanitize-html](http://npm.im/sanitize-html).
